[City of Marion](https://cityofmarion.in.gov) website built with [CraftCMS 3](https://craftcms.com) and a lot of ðŸ’œ.

*This project is in active development.*

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository!
2. This repository already contains all necessary files, simply run `composer install` to get going.
3. To get the javascript and stylesheets built, you need to make sure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) are installed first. Even better would be to use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)!
4. Once those are installed, simply run `npm install` to download everything required to build and `gulp watch` to build the javascript and stylesheets. It will continue to watch the folder for any changes you make too!
4. Bonus: I've included [nystudio107](https://github.com/nystudio107/)'s handy [Craft scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts). To use them, duplicate the `example.env.php` file in the scripts directory, and rename it to `.env.php`. Then open up the `.env.php` file in your favorite editor, and replace `REPLACE_ME` with the appropriate settings.
5. You're all set. Enjoy!
